# RhoStats

The source code for my data/analytics blog. Now in Node.js on the Express web framework!

The goal of this site is to showcase all the analytics projects I've worked on over the past few years (e.g., Twitter/news scrapers, basketball analysis, sabermetrics, etc.). And, since I'm an aspiring web developer, it will also serve as a showcase for my sweet web dev skillz.

I had originally written this in Django and deployed it on Google App Engine; however, I didn't like the way it looked and felt (it was baby's first app). So, I scrapped it and decided to rebuid it in a completely new language/framework.

I will be building it using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js). For the css, I'll use Bootstrap and some third party templates (current one is from here: http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/).
